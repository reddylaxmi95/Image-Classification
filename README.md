# X-Ray Image Classification
The project is of a classification problem where given an input chest X-ray image, the deep learning based model must detect whether the subject of study has been infected by COVID19 virus or not. Its a Binary classification problem
	Developed a convolutional Neural Network using keras and tensorflow libraries to classify the image data with accuracy of 0.87.
	Implemented Transfer learning algorithms VGG16 and MobileNet.
	Developed a CNN network with multiple pooling technique which improved the accuracy and provided the best val_accuracy score of 0.98 and val_loss of 0.07.
	Implemented callbacks in the network using  ModelCheckpoint and CSVlogger.
